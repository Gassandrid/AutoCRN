# Automatic CRN entry macro

Quite a simple program. The first time you run it, it will prompt you for your CRN numbers and create a config file. After that, or the next time you run it, it will listen for the hotkey `CMD+SHIFT+o`. You can change this in the code very easily.

## Running the program

You will need to have `rust` installed. You can install it either with your package manager or by using the official installer. You can find it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

I would provide a compiled version but this is so easy to run so like.

Just:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gassandrid/AutoCRN

cd AutoCRN/

cargo run
```
